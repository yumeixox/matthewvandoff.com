Hey, welcome to the repo for my personal web development portfolio!

It's pretty much a standard React project but the SYFR demo and the Tic-Tac-Toe parts were pretty much dragged in as external React components. Because of that, some things may seem a bit awkward. Like the random use of jQuery in the Tic-Tac-Toe part. You can find all the components in the src directory.
